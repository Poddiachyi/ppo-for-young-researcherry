## Getting started

Make sure you have all CUDA dependencies, then install

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

for GPU version or

```
pip install tensorflow
```

for CPU version.

Then

```
pip install tensorforce
```

### Run

For running with default parameters simply use

```
python cart-pole.py
```

See other parameters [here](https://github.com/Poddiachyi/ppo-for-young-researcherry/blob/master/cart-pole.py).
